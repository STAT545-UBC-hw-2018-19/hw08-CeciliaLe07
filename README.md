# Welcome!

This is the repository of the [**3rd assignment**](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/blob/master/assignments/hw08/hw08.md) at **STAT547**.

In this repository, you will find all used files to create the [**Happiness World** shiny app](https://cecileon07.shinyapps.io/world_happiness/).


### The app

This app allows you to explore the dataset [world-happiness](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) by continent, regions, and countries! All along the period from 2015 - 2017, providing you some statistics graphs and dynamic rankings. 


### Data Sources

Thanks to [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) for share the information of happiness scores by countries, and also thanks to **Google** for providing the [geographical information](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv
) through its information for developers!
